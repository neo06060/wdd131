            <p>What is this page about? It is about information of some silverware.</p>
            <p>Why did you use that name? Wikipedia is used for information, so that is why this is called this way, as this is information about silverware.</p>
            <p>What is the purpose of it? To teach people about some silverware I handpicked (they are my favourite silverware).</p>
            <p>Will you add more silverware to the page? Surely I will, though I will need to inform myself about the ones I will add later on.</p>
